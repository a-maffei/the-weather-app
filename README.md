# The Weather App

Did the world need another weather app project? Most likely not. That said, this project was a great opportunity for me to both expand and consolidate my web development skills.

I expanded my skills while:

- Using Typescript in combination with React.js
- Implementing TailwindCSS as CSS framework

I consolidated my skills while:

- Working with [an external API](https://openweathermap.org/api)
- Building a live search bar connected to a dedicated API call
- Creating custom React hooks
